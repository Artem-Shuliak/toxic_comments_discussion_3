      "This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a \"\"diatribe\"\"; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to \"\"justify\"\" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as \"\"diatribe\"\", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )\"\n",

It's true that you were able to get me angry enough for Orangemike to feel that I deserved a mild warning, but don't let that embolden you. The fact that you have abstained from vandalism for a few days, does not mean that you are not a vandal, and your taking offense to my using the word vandal in reference to you is unwarranted, such use does not constitute a personal attack. You are a vandal. You committed vandalism, you repeated that vandalism, and it's only been a few days since then; it doesn't wear off that quickly. I would not do this exactly the same way if I had it to do over again, but my goal was to stop you, and everyone else, from vandalizing the Operation Repo article, I feel confident that I have succeed, and I feel that the allegations of me over-stepping the guidelines in my ferocity of dealing with you are both mild and debatable. It is an added bonus, that it seems you have chosen to become a responsible editor, and I, once again, thank-you for all of the things you do which make you an effective editor. HellinaBucket, your account is only a month old, why don't you just throw it away and make a new one? There's nothing wrong with that as long as you honestly intend to be a responsible editor from here on out (If you want to be extra careful that you are following the guidelines to the letter, read WP:SOCK, but the basic idea, is that making a second account is wrong if you are doing for it the wrong reasons. If you just want to change your name, or if you are embarrassed about something you did as a beginning editor that you are not going to do again, then that's fine.). Whether or not you get a new account, there is no reason for you to contact me. I began editing Operation Repo while I was checking the recent changes for vandals.

He is a woman trapped in a man's body. He does not have a mental disorder, despite the fact that it is proven to be a disorder by psychologists. Why are you calling XY a man? That's transphobia! It's racist and sexist and misogynistic and transphobic! XY does not does exist! He has never existed! SHE is XX! SHE merely LOOKED like a man but has MAGICALLY become a WOMAN by HER thoughts! Mental thought determines biology! SHE is a transwoman, not a man! Soft science psychology trumps hard science biology! There is no such thing as biology! What's a biology? That's transphobic!

You state that much of my article is contained in the other article, 'Hispanic', and should be considered for deletion. The 'Hispanic' piece is not entirely accurate.

I am appalled and insulted by his misuse of the term. In the past, I tried to edit his article but he ended up reverting it back to his original.

      "Well, in general, using examples from other articles will not be helpful, because there is a lack of consistency.  In fact, the article about Kodokan Judo is currently at Kodokan, and Itto-ryu is currently at Ittō-ryū.  Please be aware of the difference, though, between arts where the name of the martial art practiced (such as \"\"judo\"\" or \"\"kenjutsu\"\") is a part of the name of the school, and where it is just describing the school.  If it is part of the school's \"\"official\"\" name, it should be capitalized, and be included in the name of the article.  If it is not part of the school's official name, it should not even be part of the article's title, much less capitalized. Thus, I believe (and I could be mistaken) that Kodokan should actually be moved to Kodokan Judo, while Ittō-ryū should stay where it is.  A good rule of thumb might be, if you were to go to Japan, and look at the sign hanging over the front door, what would it say.  I suppose Itto-ryu might included \"\"Kenjutsu\"\" after it, but certainly any of the comprehensive koryu would have only the name of the school.  Daito-ryu, on the other hand, seems to clearly use \"\"Aikijujutsu\"\" as part of its name.  There's even a great old photo of Morihei Ueshiba from the 1930s, sitting in seiza in front of a sword stand and a hanging banner that reads (in kanji, of course) \"\"Daito-ryu Aikijujutsu\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the hyphen in \"\"aiki-jujutsu\"\", I may have actually been the one to add that originally.  It's purely a personal preference issue.  There are no rules regarding hyphens in Hepburn romanization, their use is up to the judgment of the writer to include them wherever they help to improve clarity.  I felt that an English-speaking reader with no Japanese experience might have a hard time with \"\"aikijujutsu\"\", because all of the repetitive vowels kind of make the word blur together, and it is a logical place to break the word up, without making it look like two entirely separate words. Or putting it another way, it makes \"\"aikijujutsu\"\" readily identifiable as a compound word, and clearly shows the two root words.  I am not at all attached to doing it this way, though, and would have no problem with them all being changed back to \"\"aikijujutsu\"\", if anyone feels strongly about it.  \"\n",

      "The translation as such is fairly accurate, but there is problem with diffent contexts. Detain/Häktad has different meaning especillay from a legal point of view, but I think that is understable and can be accepted. That the word Rape has different meaning is harder to pass by without clarifying. I have worked much with the article om sv:wp om rape, and know that English and US law defines this very differently from Swedish law and it is possible some mentioning of this would be necessary to make it understable for a person not from the Nordic countries. Also I think, but am not cetrain, that the actual charges are made in a more general wordings, more making references to several legal clauses. And that, if the interogation goes to a legal case, the actual wording of the charge then would be more specific, as one of the aim of the \"\"prestudy\"\" is for the prosecuter to be more certain of what legal cluses to persue. So in some ways to includee this into the article would clarify some parts, but in orher ways it could cause even more confusion (but on a higher level..). To make it properly understandable I beleive a little more then the bare translation is needeed, but would not this be too long then?  \"\n",

      "Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record. It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different \"\"sides\"\" being numbered differently. \n",

My logic tell me that something is wrong there, and I just do not like much when people lie about their identity. But if you are Swedish then you should be more cautious about edits in one such sensitive question such as Kosovo. The fact that Albanians from Kosovo want independence does not mean that you should reject some scientific principles and to post into these articles maps whose only purpose is to remind Albanians that they once lived in the countries which enslaved them. I am Serb but I fully understand Kosovar Albanian point of view regarding Serbia. As for these maps, I wrote that to you in Serbian but I will repeat that in English: if you write about one territory then you should post there only maps which show that territory with its own borders. Two maps that you posted do not comply with this principle. If any of these two actually showed Metohija with its borders within Serbia-Montenegro or Montenegro, I would not object. But to post only maps of these two countries with no borders of Metohija shown is not a science at all.  (talk) \"\n",

      "That is \"\"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery\"\".  I am not 100% sure it is an Indigneous word though I said the place was referred to by it.  That remains correct.  Multiple layer stuff.  I suspect that 'ponde' is cheyanne or sioux as talking to those people its their word, but Sturt may very well have made that name up and I suspect he did.  Some Sioux etc were very much in the Gundagai area but Sturt may have known the word before he went downriver.  It seems he left a ponde downriver also.  Another aussie word that is native american is 'creek'.  We do not blink at its use, ever. Sturt did record the pondebadgery word.  What pondebadgery refers to is appropriate and is in context and association, just the vowles etc do not sound to me that ponde is a Wiradjuri word.  NOTE:  I did not note that it was a wiradjuri word. I only note Wiradjuri words if they have a known ethnology.  Sturt records Warby being at Pondebadgery.  This is the g.g.granddad of Ben Warby who holds the world water speed record.  Warby does not record 'pondebadgery' nor does anyone else in all of Australia's story that I am aware of and I have looked extensively. Just Sturt does though badgery or budgeri is previously recorded.  \"\"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery\"\" is more correct than what it has been edited to as that edit seperates Sturt from the word when no one knows that at all so its factually incorrect and should not be done as its making something that was correct as it stood, into fiction.  The cod story is very correct.  I can't vouch for the use of 'ponde' in it as being of Indigneous origin, though.\"\n",

      "Hi, everybody. I just stumbled by this little edit war, and would like to make a few suggestions. As this article stands, it's a jumbled mess. I believe that Marie is correct, in that some semblance of encyclopedic structure needs to be used in this article. I have great respect for Logger9's expertize in these subjects that so greatly interest me, and his willingness to back everything up with a source. However, to Logger9, I think a liitle guidance may be helpful in composing a proper encyclopedia structure. Encyclopedic writing is not like scientific writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it simple, an encyclopedia needs to be written in a journalistic format. The most important information is delivered as quickly as possible, in the first few sentences. This is done using the fewest amount of words possible, and should written so even a child can make snese of it, (at a 6th grade level). We call this the \"\"lede,\"\" and the only purpose of the lede is to answer the question, \"\"What is a liquid?\"\" It should be no more than a paragraph or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a subject such as this, an \"\"intro\"\" section would be appropriate. This is just an expanded lede. This may seem a bit redundant, but is actually extremely useful. Some people coming to this article will know absolutely nothing about science, and don't want the feeling of being thrown into a college level class head first. The intro should be written at about a 10th grade level, explaining the scientific aspects in the simplest of terms. (Imagine you're teaching a 10th grade science class. How would you explain it to them?)\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the following sections should get into college level explanations. It is perfectly acceptable to describe well established theories, and the histories behind those theories, but be careful to make it brief. The article is meant to answer the question of what a liquid is, and should not stray into the History of liquid theory. Also, when giving theory, realize that a scientific theory is really just a very well thought opinion, and should be attributed to its source. Under no circumstances should we combine theories in a way that might lead the reader to a third conclusion, unintended by the original sources. Nor should we give the impression that any theory is somehow absolute truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, you will find that most readers want information to be in its correct place. I have seen instances in the past where information was copied and pasted directly from one article to the next. This sort of redundency is usually unnecessary. It's better to add a link to the article where the info is most relevant. And, it is also very distasteful in writing to copy, even from oneself. If it is absolutely necessary to have the same info in multiple articles, then the writing should still be original. The goal is to make articles succinct ... to fulfill the readers curiosity about a subject and only that subject, but to link to any related subject that may further the reader's knowledge. By using this format, it helps satisfy everyone's curiosity before they become bored and move on.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Marie, I'm glad you explained that English is not your first language, because at first I did think the tone was a little harsh, but now it makes sense. I think Logger9 has some very useful contributions to make, so I'd love to see a discussion on how to incorporate them into appropriate places. I'm fascinated by the science, and would love it if we all could work together to make it understandable to all. (I'm sure you both are far more knowledible than I am.)

He has been criticised extensively by other users: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Hoary one of whom has remarked: the personification of everything that is wrong with wiki and the internet in general, one person who has a bee in his bonnet about something and won't listen to consenus and people with more experience and knowledge \n",

Choosing a specific year range is also somewhat arbitrary, if we chose to only look at 2005 to 2010 then I doubt either of us would say that the trend has shifted significantly. In the same way, if we expanded our search to 1990, or 1980 we might see that things go up and down over time as interest in the topic shifts and changes. It may just be the case that google doesn't have access to many sources in the early 2000s that use FGC, and that the ratio has always hovered between 4 to 1 or 3 to 1 and is not actually changing.\n",

      " Spventi: \"\"but perhaps it's safest to discuss your concerns before making arbitrary changes.\"\" - Indeedly. Sorry for my thoughtlessness.I have no intention to suggest a change from \"\"nakashite\"\" to \"\"nakasete,\"\" but would feel better if \"\"miseyo\"\" is changed to \"\"miseu\"\" or \"\"miseyou\"\" because みせよ cannot be an expression of volition.The version in Spventi referred is modernized in wording, and both of the two sources say it was written by 松浦靜山, I would say みせう is the original. Plus, the explanation 「松浦靜山の『甲子夜話』にみえる川柳。おそらくはよみ人知らず」 sounds much more reliable than 「江戸後期の平戸藩主・松浦静山が詠んだ句」. Then, みせよう should be a more adequate modern Japanese word here than みよう. I suspect that it might be a typo or mistranslation. Now, here is a third source; a text book for junior-high ISBN 4-594-03155-2, in which the one for Hideyoshi is written as 鳴かぬなら鳴かしてみせようほととぎす. Spventi: \"\"then the onus is on you to provide information that suggests otherwise.\"\" - Indeedly. But I can't find an english word to express hototogisu. That is why I questioned. It is a family of cuckoo, but smaller. And it really sings. A popular bird next to uguisu who tells you the spring has come, while hototogisu being the one for the summer. Here is an illustration. I was not suggesting to change the word, but just asking whether there was a better word to be used here. If not, it can stay as it is.Spventi: \"\"your concern about the word \"\"coax\"\" is entirely misplaced.\"\" and Jim_Lockhart: \"\"I think coax is fine for saying that\"\" - Hmmm. I withdraw. I trust you two than my dictionaries. One comment to Jim_Lockhart. Yes, he used flattery when necessary, especially in his early times, and I don't think it gives a negative feeling by describing him that way. That was not my worry. What I wanted to say was that it is only one face of him. You wrote \"\"resourseful as he was\"\", agreed.Now that I accepted the word coax and the form without first person, I admit Spventi's saying \"\"the changes you made to the English versions of the senryu were clearly not improvements.\"\" Sorry again. One last question:  don't you feel like making some mutial reference between this section and Toyotomi_Hideyoshi#Cultural_point_of_interest? \"\n",

      "I have been wondering about Polycheles typhlops. I would have nominated it myself for DYK, if only I had been able to find a good hook. It really is a fascinating animal, but there's nothing (cited) in the text that jumped out as instantly notable. I agree that the \"\"two species\"\" claim is false, and that the reference proves it (planktonic larvae can be easier to find than animals living on the sea floor at depths of >2000 m, so it's not that surprising that species have been missed). I wasn't sure if someone else would find a good way of re-wording it and save the DYK entry; I certainly couldn't think of one, but I didn't vote it down just in case. That DOI is an odd thing indeed. Springer Link definitely gives the same DOI I put in the article, but dx.doi.org doesn't recognise it. It's not even as if it's a very new article that hasn't made it into the DOI database yet. I have added a link directly to the journal article; I am wary of removing the DOI, because it *ought* to be right, although I doubt that it will come back to life. At least this way, people will find the article if they need to. Oh, and thanks for rescuing the conservation status of the Steppe Field Mouse.

So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .

      "I had created the sock to (1) upload rare Selena pictures that are not on the Internet, with this advantage no one would suspect it to be non-free (2) I had believed that since I live in Hartford, Connecticut and at the time I was vacationing in Orlando, Florida, I thought that I wouldn't get caught (3) When I was waiting for a review, I believed that my sock would help speed up the process and promote the articles. I really didn't believe I could get caught, however, I did. I am deeply sorry to have the community distrust me again. I have taken a month to think about what I have done and I am sorry to have done this. The first time I did a sock was to promote the Selena Project, however, I was also told about Jonaboy1992 (an old name I had used before I wanted to change it). I didn't know of the rule then, however, I agree that I should have been blocked for the other user I used to help promote the project. Now looking forward, I want to come back and continue to expand numerous articles as I was doing. I had expanded two articles in one day, I also had another Selena fan helping me with the Amor Prohibido page. I was teaching him the ropes of Wikipedia. I don't mind being mentored, however, Robert is the only person who stood by me. The last two came and go. I will admit, that I have some maturing to do if not a lot... however, Wikipedia is a community of people coming together to create a comprehensive site for information. Even though I was working by myself, I did worked well with others such as the GA reviews and translating articles from Arabic Wikipedians. I hope I can come back, I know that my English isn't the best even though I am a native speaker. Not everyone is perfect, and everyone has a strength... my strength is expanding Selena articles. While growing up with a family who had loved her before she was murdered and growing up with my mother who continued to play her songs, I grew to become very intelligent in Selena information. So its very easy to me to expand articles based on her. While away, I was working on several articles on the Simple Wikipedia. Thanks for accepting the apology, again it was very immature of me to do. Thanks,\n",

I dont think he would have based his views or book on somebody who learnt or spoke Tamil in say, Germany or France in the mid 19th century) faces, Caldwell is speaking about nothing but diglossia, maybe without putting it down in as many words.\n",

Talking of newsreaders and the lingo on street, I just remembered an interesting thing about the Kannada spoken by the people of South Kanara.  It is almost exactly like the one employed in the news or in formal documents, in that, they speak much the same way they and the rest of Karnataka would write.

      "Thanks for your reply.  First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:\n",

      "\n",
      "Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13\n",

      "Phil Hartman (1948–1998) was a Canadian-born American actor, comedian, screenwriter, and graphic artist. Born in Brantford, Ontario, Hartman and his family immigrated to the United States when he was ten. After graduating from California State University, Northridge with a degree in graphic arts, he designed album covers for bands such as Poco and America. Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee-wee Herman. Hartman co-wrote the screenplay for the film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and made recurring appearances on Reubens' show Pee-wee's Playhouse. Hartman became well-known in the late 1980s when he joined the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. He won fame for his impressions, particularly of President Bill Clinton, and stayed on the show for eight seasons. In 1995, after scrapping plans for his own variety show, he starred as Bill McNeal in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio. On May 28, 1998, Hartman was shot and killed by his wife while he slept in their California home. In the weeks following his death, Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes. Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was \"\"the last person you'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy, beloved by everyone he worked with\"\".

      "A backstage segment featuring dancing is certainly fancruft that doesn't belong. It being a reunion of sorts (and it being at WM) doesn't make it any more notable at all. The dance segment didn't affect any of the matches and certainly doesn't help the article.  \n",
      "I suggest moving to the notes section.   3:16 \n",
      "It's always been in the notes section, that's not the problem here. The problem is: it's a backstage segment. Backstage segments aren't notable, and don't affect the matches or anything... why add this one over others? Just because it was a reunion isn't a good enough reason in my opinion. People certainly could argue the Boogey Man/Trump segment was notable, as it featured the first time the 2 had interaction (or just on the fact Trump appeared). It's fancruft and serves no purpose except that some people might think it's \"\"interesting\"\". That's not enough to keep it on the article.  \n",

      "While I agree that the Boogeyman segment wasn't notable, this segment had the return of Slick (first time in like 15 years) and a bunch of other WWE legends. It being a reunion and at WM does help its case IMO (especially the reunion part). You are saying being a backstage segment is the problem, so you wouldn't be objecting if they had done this on the stage or in the ring? If we mentioned them in the on screen talent section, what would we put down for them so someone else doesn't remove it. It also got covered in most reviews and coverage of the event (coevering the notability part). Being cruft is an opinion; being a reunion featuring over a dozen legends and covered by almost every review makes it worth at least mentioning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Eh, the return of Slick is pretty important. I'll change my vote to Weak Support, as I had forgotten about that point. Peace,  The rid \n",
      "Covered in almost every review? I find that very hard to believe. Provide some proof. Also: so what if it's covered? The matches are reviewed in the reviews as well: that doesn't mean we will start listing highlights for each match. I also recall there being a guideline on Wikipedia about it not being a democracy: meaning not everything should be determined by a vote. I somehow think if this fancruft was gone: no one would be re-adding except for TJ. From the edit history: it seems like he was the only one re-adding it back. That certainly shows that people don't care about it. A few talk page posts in favor of it: isn't much consensus to keep it on the article.  \n",
      " and  among others. Other people have added it back, I just get to it first usually.  \n",
      "Considering OWW is a fansite, only the Slam link is reliable. Anyone can write a review and mention it: fansites aren't a reliable source. I've seen no edit history of anyone else re-adding it back, so I'm still going to believe no one else has (until I see otherwise). If I need to bring an admin into this, I will. Because in my opinion: it's a content dispute between me and TJ, as no one else seems to care much about ONE LITTLE crufty thing. Slick returned for ONE appearance, post it on the Slick article and leave it at that.  \n",
      "I could find more if I tried, that was in a quick 1 minute search. I could flip it and say only you think it should be removed. I don't see the big deal. It's not cruft, it's notable (based on what counts as being notable), an\n",

      "The International Astronomical Union invented the designation \"\"dwarf planet\"\" in 2006. Prior to that time it did not exist, and it has no meaning other than whatever meaning the IAU is pleased to confer upon it. When Wikipedia uses the term \"\"dwarf planet\"\", it means whatever the IAU means by \"\"dwarf planet\"\", regardless of what any other person may use the term to mean. The statement that there are \"\"hundreds or thousands of dwarf planets\"\" is not accurate; there may be hundreds of candidate objects, some of which might some day be accepted as dwarf planets, and there may be thousands of objects yet to be discovered which might be candidates for being labelled dwarf planets, but at this moment, there are only five objects which actually are dwarf planets. Because \"\"dwarf planet\"\" is an arbitrary label, we cannot reasonably say that, say, Sedna or Quaoar are dwarf planets; they would only become dwarf planets at such future date as they may be named as such, which depends upon obtaining accurate data as to their size, mass, composition, and shape, which is not as yet available. To say definitively that there are dwarf planets other than the five that have been named goes far beyond what Wikipedia is entitled to do. At most the project can say that certain objects, at some future date, might be designated as dwarf planets.  \"\n",

Wikipedia is meant for input by EVERYONE, including those who actually you know have knowledge about the subject at hand.  In fact Wikipedia DOES have polls, and it is true that polls are not actually needed since merely asking literally any American who lives in America and has commonly interacted with multiple races will get the answer of what is truthful.  However, since a couple of people are incorrectly insisting on publishing the article using extremely incorrect information, one of the polls that Wikipedia does do would be a way to vitally inform those people that yes, in fact, living in America DOES tell you what people use words for in America!  There was no \"\"material\"\" removed from any article since that would be physically impossible since this is both the Internet, which has no physical manifestation, as well as an article which is written using words, and therefore also has no physical items or textiles involved.  In an article about a plant which has a section describing the plants usuage, it would of course be grossly improper to then instigate a debate about whether or not that usuage is scientific by writing a sentence which states whether or not such usuage is considered to \"\"work\"\" by one person or society or research paper or another.  The appropriate and valid scope of such an article would be things regarding the plant, including how people may use the plant, which means that that scope would not include any research or debate on methods of alternative medicine and whether or not they work.                       \n",

The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green within the gold and/or on the outskirts when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",

As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.  Doing so is extremely common - how many thousands of women, for example, take their husband's surname on marriage without getting their name changed by deed poll?  Changing one's name in this way is an entirely different thing from having one's Registration of Birth amended, where specific statutes apply.  From the GRO's website: \"\"Changes to the Register of Births are almost impossible to effect and generally are only done if it can be proved that a clerical or factual error was made at the time of registration.\"\"  So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.  My understanding on the case of the transsexual who wanted to have her birth registration amended was that she wanted the gender changed (though I'm open to correction on this).  As an aside - I queried Eamon O Cuiv's use of the letter 'V' in his surname on his article's talk page, and someone pointed out he conveniently drops the 'O' from 'O Cuiv' for listing on ballot papers...  \"\n",

Unfortunately, I'm reaching my limit of usefulness as many of the references used are in French, so I can do very little background reading myself. I was hoping that you might ideally suited to take a look, being legal minded (it's the new employment contract), have more french than me, and are diplomatic as the current discussion is getting a little heated again, based on what a french source does or does not say.

But I suspect (totally off the top of my head) that there's too much variation for one article when you consider differences in: time (150M years); size; lifestyle (predator / scavenger / browser / grazer); environment; and specific clades (although clade may not be a helpful grouping, look at lions and tigers). My inclination (off the top again) would be to handle this aspect bottom up, e.g. \"\"behaviour of dromaesosaurs\"\", \"\"behaviour of large tyrannosaurids\"\", \"\"behaviour of Jurassic sauropods\"\", \"\"behaviour of large late Cretaceous ceratopsians\"\" (bound to be different from that of smaller, earlier ones because the big, late ones had horns). Even working out how to structure a set of articles on this topic probably needs input from people with knowledge of specific groups / periods. But I'm game for it, as I think structuring a large set of related articles is a current weakness in Wikipedia (I'm involved in an attempt to remedy that in 1 subject area, History of IBM mainframe operating systems, see the Talk page). \n",

In the earlier instance I pointed out the errors on Talk:Dinosaur and other defects and balance issues in Oct 2007 and nothing happened for 3 months. So I edited in Jan 2007 and my edit was reverted almost instantly. My current impression is that a certain clique thinks it owns that article and would rather revert edits not controlled by them than see the article improved by someone who's not a member of the clique and / or who (in the earlier instance) interprets Wikipedia guidelines differently from them.

This connection between community and boat supports certain theories on the history of the pre-colonial Philippines, specifically, that each original coastal “barangay” formed as a result of settlers arriving by boat from other places in Southeast Asia.\n",

How does a government decide how many credits ought to be issued (for free, I assume) to each entity before trading begins?  Indeed, most questions about emissions trading boil down to this very question.  For example, if an auction is used, and the auction is efficient, economics would predict that no trades would take place post-auction (the occurrence of such trades would imply that the auction had been improper)  making the whole concept of \"\"cap and trade\"\" actually mean \"\"cap via auction\"\".

And that I \"\"misattributed\"\" them. Fine, I'll deal with that later. Okay, so let me get this straight. People push a POV on an article. They use specific arguments to justify pushing their POV (the endless bickering over \"\"scientific consensus\"\", \"\"scientific community\"\", \"\"facts\"\", \"\"who is a scientist\"\", just read the last 3 years' discussion pages). I come onto this discussion page, and I point out how pathetic their arguments used to push their POV are.

Hence, by your own words, you are saying that all these people, the \"\"Tom, Dick, and Harry\"\"'s, are not following the \"\"scientific method\"\" and are thus not part of your \"\"scientific community\"\".

      "Yeah, it's pretty fascinating. I disagree that New Englanders moved into New York City and changed the accent to non-rhotic. Lots of people moved into New York City...Jews, Italians, and Irish being the biggest. I think New Englanders might be around # 178 on the list of groups moving to NYC, and the New Engand -ar is so different from the NYC -ar that we can forget the whole theory. Also the Northern Cities accent shift is food for a nice academic paper (that's what scholars do, right?) but incorrectly implies that northern cities like Syracuse or Albany did something or other to change the accent from the rural acreas, when the truth is that the rural accent around Syracuse is the same as that in the city. People move back and forth all the time. You have to have a big city like NYC or Boston to have enough isolation to create a new accent. There is no variation in accent anywhere from eastern NY to Syracuse, city, rural, or whatever, because people move around too much and there is no isolation. The first change going west happens in Rochester, where o changes to a. So, \"\"doctor\"\" becomes \"\"dactor,\"\" \"\"contact\"\" lenses becomes \"\"cantact\"\" lenses.

It is the task of the reader to conclude whatever he/she prefers. If there were a reliable source qualifying bush's intellectual capacity in some way then maybe it could be considered for addition in the article, but if the qualification were not good probably it would be included for ethical reasons. For the same reason the article can not suggest either that because he some education in certain universities then public image is wrong and doesn't correspond to reality (definitely it can not say that it does). It is the reader's duty to decide.   \"\n",

      "Indeed numerous Iranian media pointed that out right away.  That is why I support the idea of including \"\"Jewish\"\" at the beginning of that sub-section of the article.  It is not to \"\"single out\"\" Pilz because he is jewish per se, it is because both Iranian media as well as officials from Foreign Ministry have called it a part of the on-going Zionst smear campaign against Iran.   Pilz' \"\"early anouncements\"\",  had claimed that both final candidates of the Iranian presidency were mentioned in his \"\"extraordinarily reliable Agent D\"\" report.  So no matter which candidate won, he would have smeared the winner.   He had anticipiated that Rajsanjani wins (like most people expected) so he had initially put the focus more on Rafsanjani.  As an Iranian, I also feel this is coordinated. It is indeed hard to explain how the major Western media would be so quick to report all those allegatoins (which so far have turned out to be false) without even a cursory investigation. How could for example, AP, Reuters and AFP all three make the same mistake at the same time? And it wasn't even on just one allegation, it was on multiple.  So multiple News Agencies, making multiple mistakes that a pro would hardly ever do, all at the same time?  And I have seen a pattern like this for years on numerous other anti-Iran smear reports.  Also, you might notice how so many people involved in this very article are Jews or at least their edit history clearly shows their pro-Zionist stance.  I don't think that is accidental either, they are voluntary \"\"contributors\"\" to the same  smear campaign because they view Islamic Iran as a threat to Zionism.  The same people also have an \"\"interest\"\" on the Rafsanjani article and probably many other Iran-related articles.  \"\n",

However, given 3 other sources Vetrisimino0 says confirm Faytinga's mother's ethnicity, it seems reasonable to belive it's true.  Can you accept that, Middayexpress?

      "Answer to  \n",
      "i) \"\"your arguments are very biased and unethical.\"\". You took sentences that suit you from different documents to make a point without revealing the conclusion/true intentions of the author in your sources.\n",
      "ANSWER: I directly wrote what is written in the resolutions and books. The title of the heading \"\"The LEGAL ASPECTS of Turkey's 1974 Action \"\" cannot prevent you put the resolutions/sources that indicate the operation as illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "ii) Why didn't you write the whole thing?\n",
      "ANS: In the book, it wrote: \"\"the member states did not maintain this view after the second round of military operations\"\" is not something that is related with PACE. The views of the member states of a particular organization (here: PACE) does not bind the organization itself unless there is a resolution is made in that organization. \n",
      "\n",
      "iii) \"\"The Resolution of the U.N Security Council and General Assembly indicate that the Turkish invasion was an illegal act...\"\" in contrast with your other argument that \"\"there is no UN resolution that calls the Turkey's 1974 action as \"\"invasion\"\". \n",
      "ANS: Here, in this sentence, \"\"indicate that the Turkish INVASION was an illegal act..\"\" is a naming that is done by the author, not the UN Security Council. What is binding in UN is the UN SC as you may know. And, once again, I am backing my writing: \"\"There is no UN resolution that calls the Turkey's 1974 action as \"\"invasion\"\". If you claim otherwise, just put a resolution no/date so that we are all behind you at this point. Here is the whole UN SC resolutions: UN Resolutions. Which one of them calls the intervention as INVASION? No one! \n",
      "\n",
      "iv) Kareklas concludes: \"\"Nevertheless, having regard to the EQUALLY POWERFUL ARGUEMENTS militating against unilateral armed INTERVENTION envisaged by treaty, it may be clearly concluded that Turkey SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION in Cyprus, 1974; however, such a proposition could remain subject to criticism, in view of the peculiarities of the Cyprus issue\"\" \n",
      "ANS: Even the Greek Kareklas uses the word \"\"INTERVENTION\"\" as you see. Dear , \"\"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION\"\" even demonstrates the legality of the intervention (the fact I empasized about the legality of operation in that aspect). \"\"SHOULD NOT HAVE EXERCISED A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION\"\" means that \"\"THERE IS A RIGHT OF INTERVENTION\"\" but \"\"IT WOULD BE NICE IF THAT RIGHT WAS NOT USED AND THE ISSUE WAS SOLVED BY OTHER MEANS\"\". , if you do not understand in this way, you should develop your English.\n",
      "\n",
      "v) In 1979, JUST AFTER 5 YEARS LATER THE OPERATION, The GREECE's Athens Court of Appeals: \"\"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL.\"\" Here, GREECE's court did not distinguish between the 1st phase (20-22July1974) and 2nd phase (14-16August1974) of the operation. In 1979, both of the first and second operation already finished 5 years ago. GREECE's court, hence, thought legal situation of both of the operations, in advance of making any decision about the 1974 war. , in the sentence \"\"The Turkish military intervention in Cyprus...was LEGAL.\"\", do you find any separation about both phase of the operations? \n",
      "\n",
      "vi) So... dear , as you see, I did not take the specific parts of the sources in part. The title \"\"The Legal Aspects of Turkey's 1974 Action\"\" does not prevent you to find and write illegal aspects of the operation as well. You are welcome to state this. As long as these are not the parts of the interested parties, you can be sure that the sources you will find will be welcome. As you see, I directly write the text of PACE's resolution. PACE is not one of the two parties. I directly write the text of the decision of the GREECE's court. Here, GREECE's court certainly is a party, but indicates opinion/decision just opposite to GREECE's government.  That is, you should show sources i) not a party (neutral source) ii) one of the parties but express opposite view to the party (in which it is located) itself.  \"\n",

I have also explained specifically why I think this. Please read what I wrote again and respond to what I really wrote? The way I understand it, an article on Pakistan is being used simply in order to justify the word \"\"common\"\", whereas the articles about Europe, which both the Wikipedia article and the Pakistan E3b article must refer to, perhaps do not use that exact word, but rather give more detailed and less vague numbers and comments?

      "Kelly knew what color her eyes were when she made the song \"\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\"\". Comparing the pictures of Kelly and Belle, they do seem to share the same eye color just slightly different shades of it - Belle's eyes are little lighter. Someone made a video called \"\"Behind Belle's Hazel Eyes\"\", the person who made this video knew what color Belle's eyes were and decided to include Belle's name in the title. And if you read the comments, the people fully agree her eyes are hazel with comments like \"\"green or hazel? they look more hazel than brown or green . yup belles﻿ eyes are deffinetely hazel problem solved\"\". I like the \"\"problem solved\"\" part. With Minotaurgirl's bias against the idea of Belle having hazel eyes, I think there will always be a problem with people like her involved.\n",

Belle's name was there under the category of Hazel Eyes until Minotaurgirl came along and ruined it all. Same thing almost happened to Disney Wiki. This is Minotaurgirl's account, as you can see she got blocked with an expiry time of infinite, the reason; inserting false information, the false information being writting down Belle's eyes as brown.] And now here's Minotaurgirl on the Wikipedia. Is there any repsite from her?\n",
      "\n",
      "I noticed she has a Live Journal account. See what she has written. The lack of links speaks for itself. She thinks she actually proved Belle's eyes are brown, depsite the fact what she has presented as evidence is either a minority or a plain old lie, like the screenshots she send me. By magnifying the images, you can see her eyes are hazel-colored and not the same color as her hair at all. Notice how she's afriad to use close-ups of Belle's eye cuz she knows they'll appear hazel if she did so, thus disproving her. On her blog, she didn't mention that she was blocked on Disney Wiki, and said the only reason Disney Wiki kept Belle's eyes color as hazel was to shut up people who keep writting her eyes as hazel, when in reality the one who got shut up was Minotaurgirl as she got blocked while the others didn't. She wrote \"\"Bleh. Kids these days. This one needs a hobby. I'm tired of wasting time trying to undo this snot's damage, and I'm fairly sure the mods of these sites are too. Would it be possible to just...block this person off the internet entirely until they learn some manners?\"\" Yup, she calls people who use logic and legitimate evidence to prove their point snots and hobby-less kids if the evidence goes against what Minotaurgirl said/believes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone deserves to be blocked, it's Minotaurgirl. If it wasn't for her bias, sites like like TV Tropes, Disney Wiki and the Wikipedia wouldn't have suffered an edit war about Belle's eye color. The fact that there was never an edit about Belle's eye color until Minotaurgirl came along, says a lot. Ever since she got blocked from Disney Wiki almost an year ago, no edit war about Belle's eye color happened there either. It's like Minotaurgirl is the only person on the entire internet who refuses to accept Belle's eyes as hazel and is willing to go to every page and change her eye color to brown, just cuz she likes to think so, not because the world thinks so or any legit evidence are presented. It's like someone going around changing Ariel's eyes from blue to green, just cuz he likes the idea of Ariel being green-eyed. Thinks don't work like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "My overall opinion on Minotaurgurl. I think it's safe to say the interent is better off without her. She's toxic, she's a nuisance, she's talks trash to people just cuz they disagree with her, she lies, she mangles, twists and misrepresents other people's words, and she causes edit wars. Action needs to be taken against people like this.  \"\n",

Again, where are these persistent reverts against \"\"consensus\"\"?  I tried to edit an article about a bridge awhile back, got hammered by Noclador/Gun Powder Ma for adding citations.  Most people who actually looked at what I was trying to do stated I was editing very civil, and that these two were out of line of how they attacked me.  This time I'm trying to add back citations (and including extra ones) that show the use of Adesc Aut in Ladin.  Ok, there is disagreement if it is proper usage or not, what is new?  Noclador says he knows Ladin scholars who are adamant against its use.  Ok, get them to publish something and we can cite their opinions and add it to the article.  I do not care.  He has become utterly obsessed that I am part of some conspiracy.   It was originally a user from the Netherlands who added the Adesc Aut ,because there are a few Ladin websites that use the term.  i added the an official trilingual document from Ortisei using that term.  Are they wrong?  Maybe, maybe not, whatever, we simply cite references, we don't cite what someone told us down at the local coffee shop.  But, I dare edit any page in Noclador/Gun Powder Ma's domain, and I must therefore be attacked.  If I'm banned for a week, those two should be banned for a month for their constant bashing of anyone who edits the pages against the way they feel things should be.

      "\n",
      "re: (My talk) First off: please don't get mad at me for what I say below. I say it in good faith, and most likely a naive view.It seems to me that you're going about interwiki-linking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way. Wouldn't something along the same style as the inter-language wikipedia links (i.e. in the bar on the left of the page) be far better, and much more elegant? Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page, it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter. Additionally, there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links (i.e. you'd add one set of links on, say, Wikipedia, and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites).\n",
      "\n",
      "I can see two issues with this: 1. it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code, 2. it's not possible to use tracking categories. Hopefully the first one of these shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and if inter-wikimedia-ing becomes popular, I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal. ... or am I misunderstanding what you're doing? The above works nicely if you're just linking similar templates together, and even if you're making sure that they have similar functionality. However, if you're making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_, it's not so good. In this case, a system like that used at Help:Link would be better - having a single master copy (the best place I can see for this is on the meta), which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often. That copying could be done by a bot, say every 24 hours, with the template being flagged for human attention if it's been modified anywhere but on meta. Of course, extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified.  ''\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike I be putting this whole section in WT:TSP, but the short answer is first that I concluded last fall this belongs on Meta, and much of our 'good stuff' is already there and many of our best template programmers contribute there as well (Omegatron, CBD, etc.) But here people know me and so this is where it began. Like David, RL called (demanded!) and I went wiki-missing much of last fall, and was busy with mediation stuff when I first returned to having regular time for wiki's, then iterwikitmp-grp hit Tfd... so that boot in the rear restarted things. I'd really rather be working on categorization between here and the commons! Sigh... life is not a selection of first choices, most of the time we're lucky to be able to get one selection in our top fifteen!  I'll address your points on WT:TSP. But thanks for the interest and input. I like that idea of intersister interwiki's! As for 'What I'm doing', the WP:TSP has new revision that may help communicate the focus as I see it. This is really a local need as much as one off in the smaller sister's though Wikispecies and Wikiversity much need template expertise and libraries.  ttfn // nkB \"\n",

Moreover, (ab)using this historically inconsistent argument, they go further to say that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to biblical times. Linking the Palestinian/Philistines to their supposedly Indo-European ancestors, they argue that the Jews (an anachronism since at that period they did not exist as Jews, before the Babylonian Exile) stole the Land of the Palestinians at that very early period. This way of importing Nazi style propaganda into the conflict is widely spread in some far-right movements and has some misled followers outside those circles, unfortunately many \"\"philistines\"\" use it in an undiscriminating way.\"\"\n",

What I mean by this, if you can't already comprehend, is that many words in the British spelling include silent letters. Here's an example of one: pAEdophile. If one trys to pronounce this word by the letters, it would sound something like \"\"PAH-EHD-OH-FILE\"\", adding an extra syllable, when it's really pronounced \"\"PE-DOH-FILE\"\", which pretty much follows how the Standard English form is spelled. \n",
      "\n",

      "The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”\n",
      "\n",
      "Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.\n",
      "\n",
      "Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.\n",

      "I'm getting tired of having to scroll through several pages to get to the bottom, so I'm starting a new section.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's take a step back.  This article is the \"\"Ten Commandments\"\".  That is the verses in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 that are universally called the Ten Commandments; the ones that are debated about being placed in public school; the ones that are talked about as the fundamental of morality.  It is not about the list in Exodus 34.  The article is not about the use of the words \"\"עשרת הדברות\"\" in the Bible; it is about a particular Bible list that is called The Ten Commandments.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an important point, except that I would go further.  This article is not about a particular Bible list.  This is article about a cultural artifact known as \"\"the Ten Commandments\"\" that is strongly influenced by the Bible.  Sections of the Bible have been translated, moved around, edited, cropped, etc., and then declared \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\".  I think that many people think of the 10C as something where you just open the Bible up and there they are.  That's just not the case.  The cultural concept of \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\" is significantly extra-bibical.  Haven't you ever seen that Late Show bit where Letternman takes someone's words and edits them to say something different from what they actually said?  You can't just say \"\"well, I've quoted the Bible, so it's a legitimate representation of the Bible.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You feel that this statement is not sourced.  Yet I am sure you agree that the number \"\"Ten\"\" in the title \"\"The TEN Commandments\"\" comes from the Hebrew phrase \"\"aseret had'varim\"\" even if you personally think that this was a mistake. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, I remain unconvinced of this.  I have seen no convincing evidence that the Bible using the word \"\"ten\"\" and people referring to the \"\"ten\"\" commandments are causally connected.  I certainly am willing to accede that this may say more about my knowledge of Bible research rather than about the 10C.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think there is a better way of telling the reader that the etymology of the title \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\" for the list in Exodus 20:2–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21 is from the Hebrew \"\"aseret had'varim\"\". \n",
      "\n",
      "So there are two problems immediately apparent here.  First, you have no cite for the claim that this is the etymology.  Secondly, even if it were the etymology, that would be an issue completely separate from whether the Bible actually says that.  After all, the etymology of the term \"\"Uncle Tom\"\" goes back to a book by Stowe, even though the Uncle Tom character is not in fact an \"\"Uncle Tom\"\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Any reasonable person reading the text as it now is would conclude that the Bible, in the Ex 20 and De 5 passages, uses the term \"\"עשרת הדברות\"\".  I don't see why you insist on retaining this misrepresentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a notable issue because, as you mentioned, the Ten Commandments are widely represented as being fundamental to Western Civilization.  Besides the numerous other problems with that claim, the fact that much of the importance given to \"\"The\"\" Ten Commandments is extrabiblical opposes that view.  \n",

      "My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).\n",

In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.\n",

I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness.

All of the major movements involved  Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform  have both international histories and a contemporary international presence. The current article content does unduly reflect an American point of view, but this can be fixed. Best,  \n",
      "I did this because, after reading the page over several times, it only had US denominational connection. True we might all be aware that each of the denominations has an international counterpart - but that isn't reflected on this page, by its creator or subsequent, numerous editors. Of course if this was not the proper thing to do, it can be changed back...but the whole page would need to be heavily added to. It is a shame this couldn't be purged entirely and a new section added to the denomination page. Best wishes,  \n",

For instance, what about Israeli Orthodox commenting on American movements, or vice versa? We certainly don't want to have this \"\"relationships\"\" topic segmented for UK and Germany and Hungary, because movements and individuals  constantly interact and comment across geographic boundaries.

      "VQuaker.  I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, \"\"someone you know\"\" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can \"\"talk\"\" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.  I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies?\n",

That cash register key the manager uses when you return something, yep, someone you know.  An that's been around for decades!  Sign up for an account with an ISP, there it is again!

The Church was not only targeted because it owned land but because they controlled all aspects of society (i.e. from marriage to baptism to last rites and burial on church grounds).  Secular reformers saw this as a stranglehold whereby the Church could get anything it wanted not just from owning land but by controlling who could marry, have a legitimate child or even \"\"die within the Church\"\".  The Church was also targeted because it tended to support the landowners in a conservative alliance.  Finally, the Church was targeted by a number of revolutionary regimes because it had supported the Spanish monarchy against the rebels.

In the event they do return, they'll either continue disrupting the project (in which case it's easy enough to re-block) or will contribute helpfully (in which case we're better off than when we started); in the former case, the indefinitely blocked vandal will be quite able to return using another account, anyway, so the term \"\"indefinite\"\" can be a bit misleading.

      "As a Professor of Law at BYU from 1973-1996, his teaching and research focused on family law and education law, with particular interests in the legal rights of children and in the legal status of marriage.  A sample of his scholarly articles includes publications in the Harvard Law Review, Harvard International Law Journal, Michigan Law Review, Duke Law Journal, Ohio State Law Journal, and the American Bar Association Journal. Two of his articles were cited in opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has been an invited speaker at professional conferences on family, education, and constitutional law in a variety of international and domestic locations.\n",

      "In a 2009 speech in Utah, Hafen spoke to Evergreen International, a support group for people who desire to overcome their own same-gender attraction. A portion of his remarks summarized “the secular case against same-gender marriage.” He cited the 2006 decision of the French parliament rejecting gay marriage so that children “do not suffer as a result of situations imposed on them by adults.  The interest of the child must outweigh the exercise of freedom by adults, whatever life choices are made by the parents.”  He also stated that same-sex attraction is “not in your DNA,” observing that while “inherited susceptibilities” and “natural personality traits do influence one’s inclinations” toward same-gender attraction, the “idea that there is a ‘gay gene’” that determines gender attraction “has little scientific support.”  He stated that the gay rights movement represents “an aggressive political movement” more than it represents “substantive change in the medical or legal evidence.”  For example, he said, the decision of the American Psychological Association to remove homosexuality from its list of mental disorders in 1973 came from “putting the issue to an open vote in their professional meetings—not because of any change in actual medical findings.” \n",

      "I hate to bring this up, but I don't care if the content you removed from National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma was relevant or not; the edit summary you left was, in my opinion, inaccurate, and, more importantly, was really insulting to me. You shouldn't just remove everything that makes the office unique; how's it different from every other office then? Undoubtedly, some of that information was in fact irrelevant or excessive, but instead of actually doing anything to help the article, you have done nothing more than strip it down. I know that you have made some great contributions to the wiki, but that edit summary was kind of like a slap to the face. If the content you removed was entirely non-unique and useless, then your edit summary might have been a bit more justified, but that was most certainly not the case. I'm not going to call you lazy or insult you (I don't think you're lazy, that's not what I am implying), but I am going to say that you could have done better. I've dealt with enough of this sort of gesture. Through all of this, I am trying to remain as civil as possible, but if you are going to say that you don't like the article as is, make more of it than simply stripping it down. There are other areas of the office's history which I would far rather expand upon, but I would likely be heavily restricted in terms of finding non-primary sources. I hate WP:PRIMARY enough; that's one of the reasons I been dealing with many problems from some editors. That's part of what forced me to userfy the page, which in turn is part of the reason for which next to no editors aside from myself have edited the article. No one wants to edits a user space draft apart from the relevant user. That's why I have received little input on the article. In any case, please just be kinder in the future; I intend no offense here, and I will admit that there were and are problems with the article, but please do not just go around removing cited content without also helping to build as well. Please don't take any offense or think me \"\"foolish\"\" or something (I don't know what you will think when you read this) like some editors would. I don't want this to be some sort of major issue in the future; I just really don't want this to happen again. Please take all of this to mind.

Its different for World War II era, or precisely the period between 1930's to 1949. Because during those times there was maximum of 100 species described (in total). But after 1950, we see a huge increase in entomology enthusiasm. I know much about beetles categories, but Category:Beetles described in 2006 is the main category which have close to 100 species, and will probably increase. Either way, you should agree (and so the deleter as well), that the Animals category becomes very claustrophobic and difficult to navigate through. Yes, it carries the alphabet, but even with that in order to find a specific species (especially if a user look for moths) is still difficult.

On the other hand, all of Warren's ancestors are white.

Those flight logs had not been available for over 30 years, and even then, likely only to Bush's superiors in the Air Guard/USAF.

      "Certainly from what ive seen, read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and  just North India (not south India); yet i don´t agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people, since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so. We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)\n",

      "So what i mean, is that if we talk about \"\"gypsy\"\" people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.\n",

      "That is why many people feel (i am one) that \"\"roma\"\" people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say). \n",

What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.\n",

      "\n",
      "The dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.\n",

      "Hi Asher196. I have come here to follow up with you about Image:MeijerGardensAmericanHorse.jpg‎. I used to contribute a lot of images to wikipedia, back about a year and a half ago I would make trips to specific locations to take high quality pictures for inclusion on Wikipedia. In doing so, I learned more about copyright of photography than most lawyers do (because most lawyers do not work in the copyright space). Suffice to say that your perception of image copyright is an incorrect one. A summary of image copyright has been written elsewhere far better than I can try here, but i am so out of practice on WP I cannot find it. First, please carefully read the copyright template that I have placed upon this image. The image is copyrighted because it is a 2d representation of a 3d statue. Statues, just like paintings, soda can artwork, music and movies are copyrightable. As such, one cannot make derivitives of that work that one can license (i.e. take a picture). If one takes a photograph of a statue, the original copyright holder still retains rights over that image, rights that can only be bent through the implying the fair use provisions of copyright law.\n",

      "I was involved in a rather epic struggle between good (fair use) and evil (anti-copyright) people on Wikipedia, one that we sadly lost because this project is dominated by people who are so leftist and anti establishment that they desire nothing short of completely free. Sadly, this is a battle my side eventually was overcome by noise and numbers generally, but even these nazi's must admit defeat in the face of being able to include photographs of statues. There is no other option. One simply cannot create public domain or freely licensable photographs of statues. I hope this post brings to you a greater understanding of copyright of images and will serve you in your future editing.\n",

Certainly, Europe has adopted Techno as it's own, more than America or even Detroit ever has or did, but unless we can get some REAL citations going we need to remove, what I see as, the wishful editing claims that Techno began in Western Europe. We REQUIRE citations. I'm honestly pretty neutral in this, I enjoy techno, but I prefer other genres. I just happened to stumble across the article, read the first sentence and checked the \"\"citation\"\" for the Western Europe claim (as it was news to me) and was sent to a dead page. I searched \"\"techno origins\"\" and found numerous pages saying Detroit birthed techno and added those cites. The evidence is just flat out contradictory to what some editors (wish to) believe. Honestly I do not care, but if Wikipedia is to be a reliable source, we as a community must be honest with what the facts are, or provide evidence (in citations) for alternate claims. I won't be doing any further edits in this article, I'll leave this one alone, I can sense this could turn ugly real quick, so I leave it to people who care more than I do. Ultimately, if I'm wrong fine, no biggie, just please give good citations.\"\n",

      "  Central figures behind FishBase are Daniel Pauly and the fish biologists around him at the UBC Fisheries Centre. FishBase itself is supervised by an international consortium which fields many of the world's most prominent fish scientists. The consortium includes the FAO itself, so in that sense it would be true to say that FishBase and the FAO are entangled. The central fisheries scientist at the FAO for many years was John Caddy. Daniel Pauly and John Caddy have, over the years had conflicts which could be regarded as representative of conflicts between FishBase and the FAO. Two high profile examples that spring to mind were a disagreement in 1999 over fishing down the food web, and a conflict in 2001 over FAO fishery returns. I have never seen FishBase and the FAO disagree on the common names of fish. That issue would arises only in relation to commercially significant fishes, since the FAO does not concern itself with fish that are not commercially significant. Presumably many wide ranging accommodations and rationalisations have been made within the FishBase consortium, and suppose this would be an example of one of them. We cannot know for sure, since the consortium doesn't seem to make its deliberations public. But the attempts some editors are making on this page to discredit FishBase are, well just plain ridiculous.   23:33\n",

      "But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources. This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article. I tried reflecting it as follows: \"\"His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who \"\"considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth\"\" but this was dismissed as \"\"speculative opinion\"\" by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography. Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment). Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle.  \"\n",

      "For instance, many of the large square rigged ships did move essentially through the force of the wind pushing on the sail. I suppose technically the wind is piling up behind the sail (thus high pressure area) and the difference in pressure between the higher and lower pressure areas on opposite sides of the sail causes it to move, which is the same principle as that which generates lift. However, unlike in the case of aerofoils (aka wings) there is *not* a higher wind speed going across the back of the sail than the front.\n",

I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.

But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.

So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me \n",

You have demonstrated - not simply to me; not simply to Wikipedia; but to THE WORLD AT LARGE - that you are incapable of editing in good faith. When the mainstream media characterizes you - Qworty - as a ranting, slanderous, biased editor, then... well, we should take that seriously.  I do hope you've read the Salon article about you? If not, let me quote: your screed was interpreted (rightly) as \"\"an apoplectic defense by one Wikipedia editor of actions that other Wikipedia editors labeled 'revenge editing.' There’s a lot of anger here (not to mention an unhealthy fixation with excrement!). Call me persnickety, but reading Qworty’s comments did not give me the greatest faith in Wikipedia’s internal process for building an encyclopedia of human knowledge.\"\"\n",

As for Little green rosetta: I've been giving her the benefit of the doubt. Even though she accused me - on the basis of what she termed \"\"behavioral and technical evidence\"\" - of using sock puppets.

      "Wikipedia has started to hit the big time. Accordingly, several critical articles have come out, including \"\"The Faith-Based Encyclopedia\"\" by a former editor-in-chief of Britannica and a very widely-syndicated AP article that was given such titles as \"\"When Information Access Is So Easy, Truth Can Be Elusive\"\".\n",

      "\n",
      "First problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.\n",
      "\n",
      "My point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "You might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers.

They have translated the relatively synonymous terms 'Khristós' and 'Messiah' into English, giving each a distinct usage. Joseph Smith seems to have followed the same patterns in translation, because the purpose of a translation is to convey the meaning of the base language, not to be overly literal. Obviously, the word \"\"Khristós\"\" would not have been etched on the plates; the Nephites didn't speak Greek, just as they didn't speak French (see the end of the Book of Jacob). Joseph Smith chose to translate whichever word or character WAS written into the English word \"\"Christ,\"\" because that is how \"\"Christ\"\" is used in not only modern English, but in the English Bible itself. The fact remains that English Bibles use the terms \"\"Christ\"\" and \"\"Messiah\"\" in the same way that the Book of Mormon does, which the critics fail to mention (and they do not fault the Bible for doing so).\"\n",

In sharp contrast, the global satellite temperature was stated by the majority of scientists to be the most credible scientifically. Moreover it is corroborated by the Meteorological balloon data. And independent evidence from growing Antarctic ice, that this year global sea ice is back to normal and even Greenland surface ice is growing strongly suggests that there is no current warming and that the surface data is corrupted either by these warming adjustments or by urban heating. Moreover the satellites are far more global than the surface data - and the increasing ice shows the areas they miss at the poles are not melting.\n",

The pathological murderers like Maks Luburić or totalitarian dictators like Ante Pavelić cannot cast the shadow on all the participants in the Ustaša military forces, any more than Joseph Mengele or Adolf Hitler can contaminate the memory of German soldiers, particularly Waffen SS who fought in the WW2. This is even more true about ordinary people or intellectuals who participated in the NDH regime (for instance, Adolfo Bratoljub Klaić, the author of famous dictionary of foreign words, or the sculptor Augustinčić, who made a bust of Pavelić, but later switched sides. Do I have to repeat ? The NDH was a quisling state. The vast majority of people involved with it and working for it were neither quislings nor criminals. And, this is just the NDH talk. Let's not forget that, as far as resistance movement goes, the Croats were the majority both in leadership and in fighting forces who were not forced to   join the resistance (like the Serbs in the NDH), but did it out of ideals.

Only in Eastern Orthodox streams of Christianity is the Septuagint the standard Bible.

      "No one is disputing that a debate exists over the proper naming convention, the question is over the degree to which that debate should be reflected in the name of the article. I'm all for delineating the various points of view on why one name is used by one group of people, and the article does a good job of that. But as you point out the most widely used name is FGM, and if a 4.5 or 3 to 1 ratio is not a significant  majority than I don't know what it is. Secondly, the pov issue is very much with the people here and not with the literature. Lets be clear about the rationale of the UN bodies which have opted to use the term FGC. According to their own websites (and this page), they use the term FGC in communities where the term FGM may be seen as counterproductive to the goal of reducing the occurrence of FGM. They do not use it in their published literature and their websites make it clear that it is an application of the term for case-specific scenarios and not as an overall attempt to cease the use of the term FGM.   19:48\n",

But with a ban, he'd just be restricted from those category pages and others' userspace. He could edit and talk in the non-categorized (econ, etc.)  and revert obvious vandalism type stuff. Now will he agree to a voluntary ban? I doubt it. He has not reacted very positively to my proposal. Instead, \"\"you guys\"\" must comply with his conditions, e.g., stop me, Rubin & SPECIFICO from harassing him. And consider his latest example. He cites one thread that was civil, verses the 116 diffs that I complied. (I'd proposed the Editor review to him before, but he won't do it.) Forgive me, Writ Keeper, if I complain too much here, but X goes on and on – not just on the talk pages. He creates new, lousy stuff, and then links it on other pages which have marginal relevance. (Example, his Scroogenomics article, created with three edits, and then linked here and there. So who contributed to Scroogenomics? X did 3 edits, 72Dino did 10, I did 9, Rubin, SPECIFICO, and the bot each did 1.) X asks if anyone objects to posting stuff, which can't be ignored because he'll take it as a green light for more lousy editing. Okay. I'll stop. Maybe I'll repost my .

As the principal founder and keeper of copies of written records concerning many such events, I though it would be useful to pass along some of that detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The particular events I commented on concerning Richard Stallman were the product of Symbolics’ employees still using computers in the MIT AI Lab.  Our employees had begun to notice that software which they had authored and placed under the Symbolics' copywrite notice had started showing up in the software released to other licensees but without the Symbolics copywrite notice.  One of our employees, Dave Andre, extracted MIT Lisp machine screen session copies from various Lisp machines in the AI Lab and found that Richard Stallman had been the one removing the Symbolics copyrights and giving our software to the other Licensee, LMI.  Andre made paper copies of the incriminating screen sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "These paper copies and the above explanation were presented to me by Dr. John Kulp, our VP of R&D.;  When John and I presented paper copies of these screen sessions to the AI Lab Director, Prof. Patrick Winston, and insisted that he stop his employees from breaking copyright law, he called Stallman in and barred him from entering the AI Lab and from using its computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Stallman and Richard Greenblat, as I recall, took the position that although the MIT Lisp Machine technology license under which Symbolics, Inc. and Richard Greenblat's company had obtained their rights to use and sell the MIT technology, the “intent” of the license had been that enhancements would be shared freely among licensees and MIT.  Of course, when I negotiated that license, I had intended and stated carefully in the license that licensee produced enhancements would be copyrighted and not made available to competing licensees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greenblat had represented the AI Lab as well as his own company, LMI, during the negotiation for the license which both LMI and Symbolics ultimately executed.  Wording to express this particular issue had caused Greenblat considerable difficulty but he had been forced by the MIT administration to accept it just as Symbolics wrote it so he knew well what was intended and that the intent had been clearly expressed in the signed licenses.\n",

Major storms passing within 50 miles off our coast ('38, '44, Donna, Belle, Gloria) causing a \"\"direct hit\"\" are far more common, and can be just as damaging and deadly. I would say that a repeat of '44 today, would cause Katrina-like damage in the Northeast. New Jersey might be small, but it is also the most densely populated state in the nation. Many of the homes, especially those along the shore, are only a few feet apart.  A good storm surge like seen in '44 would devastate 100 miles of prime real estate that is far more valuable per square mile then that along the Gulf Coast. Also, strong storms passing to our west (Gale of 1878, Tropical Storm David in 1979) can put N.J. in a storm's right front quadrant, the most vicious part of the cyclone\"\n",

The Article Rescue Squadron works by tagging articles with a template, so that other editors are alerted to the existence of a speedy, prod, or AfD nomination.

      "\": FOR THE RECORD. Danny, you love to weave more straw men and avoid the real issues at all cost, as you have just beautifully demonstrated. As for me insulting you, it came because of you making provoking insults at me, calling me a \"\" hog and pig\"\" in one of your previous replies on 5 July 2005 15:46 (UTC). If you were using that kind of language with members of the public in the street, you would no doubt be quickly punished and hospitalised for your insulting provocations, and you have also demonstrate why many Jehovah's Witnesses who follow your methods actually incite hate against themselves and their religion due to their shameless insulting and provoking behaviour. You then make more revealing and completely false remarks: \"\"As Central is fond of pointing out ad hominem arguments are a logical fallacy. By the same token anything he says about me is quite frankly irrelevant to the real issue\"\". I pointed out to you, that when I insulted you it did not prove your argumentation wrong (you prove yourself wrong by your manipulative specious methods and lack of any evidence), so therefore, it was not ad hominem at all, but just an insult from your own provoking insults of which you appear to measure by another set of biased scales. Secondly, all the points I have made about your false conclusions and your false logic are all valid as they prove that you are not objective or reasonable at all, and have zero evidence to base your claims on, and are often very slanderous of others (Raymond Franz in this case) with no evidence to back your claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "YOU Danny Muse, have failed to answer a single point of mine (a typical JW trait), which were about your logical fallacies, your use of slander, your negative propaganda, and your rhetoric. I have asked you again and again for proof of your statements and claims on Franz, and you have dramatically failed on all accounts to bring them on. Here again is the challenge summarized: I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is \"\"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body\"\" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated. . . your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on this matter. . .. If you can bring on proof, then you can have an opinion that the book descriptions are 'this or that' etc., until then all you say is biased POV and unfounded. You have no right to say or edit anything on this particular subject, as you have demonstrated that truth on the matter and literature is not a subject you are interested in. Please read Proverbs 18:13. Posted Central 19 July 2005 (PS. I'm sure you will ignore all this and make up some more straw man to focus on to take the light off your complete lack of evidential backup to your claims about the books and Raymond Franz's character etc. The original book descriptions should stay, as they are brief, to the point, accurate, and give enough information to know the basic book's content. If you disagree then prove it, don't vandalize out of spite as you have been doing.)Also, I see ''' checked the entire critical sections and made some edits on 18 June 2005, and approved the extended book descriptions, which you have totally ignored, therefore it was a yes vote, not a no)\n",

Your proposed addition is mostly okay, and gives a good treatment to the question of how the word \"\"terrorist\"\" is applied to the organization.  I would add the FBI website, and the fact that it was one of the organizations on the FBI's terrorism task force watch list.  There are plenty of categories, too many probably, available to help direct readers interested in the topic of terrorism to this article.  Category:Terrorism in America is one of them; the one you just added (:Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the U.S. government) is another.  There is a huge BLP concern with branding living ex members as terrorists, particularly unconvicted ones who deny the charge.

      "Elonka - I understand that Verbal did not block me, but is it true that he had nothing to do with it? I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user's approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the 'proper' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal's standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal's aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal's overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He's not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That's not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It's quite clear that he's an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent.

Stating that people with albinism also can have nearsightedness and farsightedness is like saying people with pneumonia can also have a clubbed foot. When you list signs and symptoms of a disease, you limit them to the ones that are caused by or associated with the specific disease. Astigmatism is on the cornea, more rarely in the internal lens, and is an error of refraction. It has absolutely nothing to do with the pigment in the retinas. Albinism is a lack of pigment, the cornea doesn't need pigment to develop properly. The fovea, however, needs a normal RPE to develop properly. It isn't actually known why, but we do know this to be the case. In order to save myself time looking each fact up, I will just cite the most encyclopedic text and I'm sure every one of these points is there. However, you can't just point to one sentence and say \"\"here it is\"\" you actually have to study the entire book to get an understanding of all this information. For example, you are never going to find one sentence in any text that states specifically that \"\"albinos have the same prevalence of nearsightedness as the regular population.\"\" No text would ever say that. They would say in one spot what albinism is, and in another spot say what nearsightedness was, and leave it up to the reader to understand the two have nothing to do with each other. Otherwise they would have to say in the description of each disease all the other thousands of diseases that have nothing to do with it. Would I look up pneumonia and find a specific sentence, \"\"pneumonia has nothing to do with clubbed foot.\"\" It seems to me that the original writer needs to cite a reference that albinism is associated with refractive errors, and if not, it just needs to be deleted. I can't cite a reference for a null, I can't cite a reference for someting I deleted. Do I just leave a blank line and cite why it's not there?

You drift into pure editorializing; this needs some other formulation that isn't a pure projection of your opinion and/or personal experiences. I happen to be a champion within the Waldorf movement of revising the emphasis on the eight-year class teacher period. But the opposite of \"\"brochure speak\"\" is \"\"antagonist speak\"\"; both may make statements that appear clear, objective and meaningful to the person making them - but are too broad and too vague simultaneously. It is \"\"weasel\"\" language; unattributed, both unprovable and undisprovable. \"\"  The percentage of teachers who make it through 8 years with a single class is staggeringly LOW - so what starts as a lofty goal often ends up as an interruption of the children's education - and often under difficult circumstances.  Making the claim that a teacher stays with the class for 8 years is brochure speech not supported by reality.  It's like saying - \"\"it is the intention of each baseball player to bat 1000\"\".  It is meaningless except for the purpose of sucking people into a set of ideals that aren't part of reality.  If you don't like the statement that points out the reality of the situation, then we should remove the claim completely.\n",

Yes, let's all just scare the parents into Waldorf education.  How about just saying \"\"rhythms during the day and through the year are thought to be important\"\"?

In Waldorf, such an environment is believed to support the physical and spiritual growth of the child. Formal learning is absent, and experiences of the written language are consciously avoided.

Adler broke from Freud in 1911, and initially called his work \"\"free psychoanalysis\"\", but later called it \"\"Individual Psychology\"\". Although to a general lay public, Freud, Jung and Adler are often seen as the \"\"Big Three\"\" of psychoanalysis, in the strict sense, only Freud was a psychoanalyst.  Jung was an analytical psychologist and Adler an individual psychologist. Use of these alternative terms helps to clarify how both Jung and Adler broke from Freud and developed their own schools of therapy.  \"\n",

I do not think this fact is disputed unless there is a fringe view of what is means to be a Christian, which excludes other forms. I do not think this can be excluded as a form of Christianity without committing some basic problems in logic in regards to this definition, in particular the No True Scotsman fallacy. Until you have a good source that not only makes the case but represents the scholarly consensus on the question of a definition of Christianity that is sufficiently inclusive but still exclusive of PC as one of its manifestations of the religion, we do not get to delete the factual statement that PC is a form of Christianity. At most we can state that it is disputed, which Giovanni has done. It does not make any claim regarding the compatibility of Christianity with Nazism, but it does say that PC is a form of Christianity that is consistent with Nazism. If you dispute this, then please state what part parts of PC are not consistent with Nazism as an ideology? Lastly the major problem with your version is that it assumes there is such as thing as one kind or type of Christianity, which is of course not true, or begs the question.

I don't think there's enough published material to write an article just about clairsentience and that it should just be a subsection of ESP or another page. 90% of the clairsentience article was laying the groundwork for a state of reality where clairsentience could be real. That's fine, but it had very little had to do with clairsentience itself.

It seems that EVERY garage band from California has used the name \"\"The Squids\"\"  at one time or another roughly since 2008 as far as I can tell.  These are NOT Squids tribute or cover bands either.  Maybe this is where the original confusion started.  To research The Squids,  please tag \"\"LaTour\"\",  \"\"Spatafora\"\",  and \"\"Chicago\"\" and i believe this will become crystal clear to anyone investigating \"\"The Squids\"\".

Problem with this article is that it speaks from just one contex, while ignoring the others (for Hungarians living in Vojvodina prior to 1920 Vojvodina was nothing less than Hungary). I think that solution to this is obvius. First, there should be a prefix Serbian in the title, as this article obviously talks about formation and creation of entity of Serbian Voivodina, and not about other entities (kingdom of Hungary,lands of Hungarian counts) which existed in the region. Second it should have link to another article Vajdaság, which should explain history of Hungarian people in that region the same as this article is centered about Serbian people.

The fine, close-in, adjustments were made with newly tested (at the time) code using Clohessy-Wilshire equations, and using all available sensors in the aft cockpit.  These were extensively tested in both 3-DOF and 6-DOF simulators before proximity targeted maneuvers were approved by NASA.\n",

That's one more proof you don't read thoroughly what people write - and similarly, you don't check thoroughly things which you delete. Thus, I'm not convinced you can give any actual evidence there's an explainable reason for deleting it. The quote I provided in the initial letter here is a quote from the creator of this project. He said his opinion about you clearly. Not that he cares about any Wiki trolls, Mr know-it-alls and control freaks. The fact that he doesn't even bother wasting his nerves on this discussion here is eloquent enough. But I do care when I see injustice. Not that my \"\"little rant\"\" would change anything. But am I someone who remains silence? I could at least make my \"\"various pronouncements\"\" when I saw injustice. Wikipedia at least allows this, doesn't it? As for the proofs, links and evidence you requested, I shall commit my efforts to collecting them with the guidance from the original creator of the Alphistia project, and present them to you here. After that, it is up to you, to show whether justice really exists in Wikipedia or it is really subject to control by self-authorised junkies as my impression has always told me.\n",

Moreover, I cannot see how you made the conclusion that Alphistia was \"\"made up in school in one day\"\" by reading \"\"my webpage\"\". And, aren't most other invented utopian micronations created in exactly the same circumstances? Isn't this exactly what it's all about? It's not about existing micronations.\n",

This project has been around the place for many years, and has been presented in internet space for quite a long time - and in more than one place (it has its own website, its own LiveJournal blog and a network of fans and devotees who have developed a community and have even started learning the invented language of the micronation in question) - but all this remained out of your sight as you were deleting it at random, without even checking anything about it.

      "Well if you want to sincerely discuss it I can make an exception as I have the expertise and have some time so I ask you first to consider the full context of the selections you outline. The Aurobindo letter begins: \"\"All these experiences are of the same nature and what applies to one applies to another. Apart from some experiences of a personal character, the rest are either idea-truths, such as pour down into the consciousness from above when one gets into touch with certain planes of being, or strong formations from the larger mental and vital worlds which, when one is directly open to these worlds, rush in and want to use the sadhak for their fulfilment. These things, when they pour down or come in, present themselves with a great force, a vivid sense of inspiration or illumination, much sensation of light and joy, an impression of widening and power. The sadhak feels himself freed from the normal limits, projected into a wonderful new world of experience, filled and enlarged and exalted; what comes associates itself, besides, with his aspirations, ambitions, notions of spiritual fulfilment and yogic siddhi; it is represented even as itself that realisation and fulfillment.\"\" In short they are talking about planes of consciousness (basically astral and mental planes) which more experienced occultists are familiar with as actual realms. Ancient occult lore is true that there are stages of awakening to these planes which is what is meant but the danger is in not being able to handle the energies and conscious influences, archetypal forms and beings there so that one becomes more of an intermediate zone medium (a sad state some of us have actually observed which is why Kazlev popularized the concept). This becomes clearer once you read the full text of Paul Brunton's Chapter on the Intermediate Zone here: http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/16/12. \n",
      "\n",
      "Brunton's beginning point is that: \"\"The pathway of the mystical goal is strewn with human wreckage. Why? Several reasons would be needed to give a complete answer but one of the most important is this: Between the state of ordinary man and the state of the matured mystic there lies a perilous and deceptive psychological region which has been given various names in mystical literature. It has been called the astral plane, the intermediate zone, the hall of illusion, and so on. The early efforts of all aspirants in concentration, meditation, self-conquest, and study, bring them into this region. But once here their egoism becomes stimulated by the subtle forces they have evoked, their emotional nature becomes more sensitive and more fluid, their imaginative power becomes more active and is less restrained. The consequence of failure to negotiate these changes properly is swollen vanity, superstitious credulity, emotions run riot, and imagination gone wild. The safeguards against all this are first, submission to the philosophic discipline and second, submission to competent guidance.\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate that you have more of a Buddhist orientation in your views while the sources use Hindu based concepts. In this case to say that the IZ is similar to a Buddhist concept of a spiritual bypass which is \"\"a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks\"\" is sufficiently related to the IZ concepts of Aurobindo and Brunton to justify combining rather than cross referencing them, is to miss the import of the IZ concept. You would be familiar with the Buddhist wheel of life with its different realms of being. A more Buddhist way to look at it would be that you have to pass the tests of illusion and influences of certain beings of each realm up to and including Mara to truly get through the IZ (and free of the wheel), and it is too dangerous without a proper guide. While Buddha (or for that matter any enlightened being) is fully awake and present on every level of the wheel) the aspirant is only awakening slowly from the dream and can be easily confused. Even highly practiced, relatively balanced and well meaning spiritual people can and do fail to pass through the IZ. The \"\"spiritual bypass\"\" is a concept far too psychological to express the broader meaning of the IZ. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I think your idea has some merit and certainly the article can and should be improved but a better solution would be to improved the cross referencing and not just force an integration of the terms. I hope you take the time to thoroughly review Aurobindo and Brunton's full exposition of the concept before pushing ahead. I have no difficulty with you taking over lead on the article in that case. All I ask is that editors be thorough and give some weight to those with expertise on a specific topic.   \"\n",

There are many examples of articles on this website that provide info about controversial issues in a neutral position while usually providing material for and against the issue. I think that that would be the only way to present a truly fair and neutral portrayal of Max Muller. One other consideration for yourself would be what is you consider a mainstream opinion, because I am sure that you are aware of the politics that goes into getting a paper published and the biases that can play for or against it. Finally, your vehement refutation of other sources based on \"\"who is he?\"\" shows your own inability to question and research into ideas contradictory to others. I would recommend that if you are going to portay a neutral article, please do so by giving both sides of the story.

Repeating a false claim thousands of times does not make it correct, but Debian just uses copies of their false claims to \"\"proove\"\" their claims. So what remains? The only provable facts are that Debian started to attack cdrtools in spring 2004 and that Debian at the same time stopped distributing the original cdrtools in favor of their own defective fork from spring 2004 that was later reamed (on my instructions) in autumn 2006.

      "I was wondering if you knew much about the Microsoft WGA program. I know there are a lot of people who think this program is spyware. My understanding was that it could be classified under this category because of how Microsoft destributes it as a critical security update on Windows Update. Not to mention the stories I have heard about the tool phoning home to Microsoft on a regular basis. One other strange thing that I have been hearing from my friend about is people going and validating their PC on the Microsoft Download Center to access a downolad. After the download is complete they run an antispyware program and find that the WGA validation tool has caused a Browser Hijack attempt. I do not know if these stories would be good material for the WGA article here on Wikipedia. I am still searching the web to see if I can find evidence to back some of this up. I was also wondering if you had heard any of these strange stories yourself. Please respond on my talk page and tell me what you think.\n",
